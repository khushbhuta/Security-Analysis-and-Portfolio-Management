# Security-Analysis-and-Portfolio-Management
THe project was a part of my elective - **Security Analysis and Portfolio Management** at BITS Hyd, as a part of my 5th Semester. This repository consists of the problem statement, final report and the code that I wrote for completing the task.

Overview:
- We were allotted 8 publicly listed firms and were asked to create an **Efiicient Frontier** using the Markowitz Portfolio Theory and a **Tangency Portfolio** for the same.
- We obtained the risk-free rates using historical data of a market index (NIFTY 50) and annualizing the returns.
- The risk-adjusted portfolios were created by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio.
- The notebook contains markdowns explaining every section of the code.
